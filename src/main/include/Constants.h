// enable this define to build vary the build for mr herzog's
// test righ that uses soem slightly different hardware including fewer drive motors
// as well as the REV Robotics ZOGBOT motor controllers
//
// if ZOGBOT is not defined, the code will build for the Porterbots' configuration
// using Cross the Road Electronics VictorSPX motor controllers and a pair of motors on each side
//
// be sure comment out the next line for a normal Porterbots build (that should be the default)
//
// this also impacts some other robot aspects like turning down the max speed and the speed
// the line alignment code uses to prevent potentially loose motors on the test rig from
// twisting around all over the place 
//
// this is a good example of how we can have a single code base with a few variations in it
// to accomodate different testing environments
//
// the bulk of the code base is totally the same with just a few small differences in the hardware being
// used - we can accomodate the hardware differences and since these differences get wrapped by the higher
// level WPILib functions, the higher level code is unchanged
